# ESCapeFromKemper-WebGLBuild
This is a WebGL build of the game [ESCape from Kemper](https://panlord.github.io/game-power-down/) that I created with a team of 4 others. The original repo for the game as a whole can be found [here](https://github.com/Panlord/game-power-down).
This repo is just for testing out how well the WebGL build can run. It is deployed on Github Pages right [here](https://panlord.github.io/ESCapeFromKemper-WebGLBuild/). As is (and as you probably can see), the game is quite laggy and does not run well on a clean, untampered chrome browser.
