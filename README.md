# ESCapeFromKemper-WebGLBuild

## The game is deployed right [here](https://panlord.github.io/ESCapeFromKemper-WebGLBuild/). 
I recommend glancing at [this](https://panlord.github.io/ESCapeFromKemper-WebGLBuild/) write-up before playing to familiarize yourself with the controls.
Also, because it is unclear: the objective you're looking for is a pure red-colored book. You'll know it when you see it.

## Information about this deployment

This is a WebGL build of the game [ESCape from Kemper](https://panlord.github.io/game-power-down/) that I created with a team of 4 others. The original repo for the game as a whole can be found [here](https://github.com/Panlord/game-power-down).

This repo is just for testing out how well the WebGL build can run. **It is deployed on Github Pages right [here](https://panlord.github.io/ESCapeFromKemper-WebGLBuild/).** As is (and as you probably can see), the game is quite laggy and does not run well on a clean, untampered chrome browser. However, if you're using a computer with a decent graphics card you can enable hardware acceleration in the Chrome settings and the game will run much more smoothly such that it is playable. Go to Chrome Settings --> System --> "Use hardware acceleration when available."

Also, for more thorough information about the game, please visit the repo and website for the game (linked above). I hope you enjoy this spooky game if you try it. (The downloadable version that gives you the executable can be found on the website.
